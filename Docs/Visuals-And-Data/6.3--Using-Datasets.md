# Using Datasets

---------------

As well as using live data, using static datasets is another technique for using external inputs.

I've used datasets during live coding sets in the past, including for the first half of my [Chemical Algorave](https://co34pt.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-chemical-algorave-culture-lab-newcastle-13-5-17) set. I've also used SuperCollider to create some works using sonification of static data sets, including [this](https://vimeo.com/110965074).

There are a number of ways to interpret datasets as sound, part of a technique commonly referred to as Sonification.

[There's a great resource on Sonification here](http://sonification.de/handbook/), but i'll cover the techniques that I have used to leverage Data in SuperCollider here, for which you should refer to the example in this repo.
