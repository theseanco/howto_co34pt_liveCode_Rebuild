# ProxySpace - My Foundation for Live Coding in SuperCollider

-----------

## Why ProxySpace?

If you haven't heard of or used it before, [ProxySpace](http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/ProxySpace.html) and it's associated [JITLib](http://doc.sccode.org/Overviews/JITLib.html) are _well_ worth knowing about, and are without exception what I use to live code in SuperCollider.

According to the docs (see link above):
>Generally a proxy is a placeholder for something. A node proxy is a placeholder for something playing on a server that writes to a limited number of busses (e.g. a synth or an event stream). NodeProxy objects can be replaced and recombined while they play. Also they can be used to build a larger structure which is used and modified later on.

In other words, ProxySpace opens up SuperCollider's language into a powerful performance tool by allowing individual functions/patterns/etc to become flexible and modifiable, as well as to make these patterns interact. When using ProxySpace, the traditional

```
{SinOsc.ar(440,0,0.2)!2}.play
```
is turned into an 'instrument' when given an arbitrary name and edited on the fly. It can also be used within other 'instruments', for example:

```supercollider
(
~sine1 = {SinOsc.ar(440,0,0.2)!2};
~modulation = {Saw.ar(10,0,1)!2};
~sine2 = {~sine1 * ~modulation};
~sine2.play;
)
```

ProxySpace can also be used for synchronising together [patterns](http://danielnouri.org/docs/SuperColliderHelp/Streams-Patterns-Events/Pbind.html) (including percussion, melodies, basses etc) in a quick and easy way, while allowing them to be edited and combined on-the-fly. Most of my live sets revolve around the creation (and destruction) of patterns, and ProxySpace makes this really quite easy. With ProxySpace I can build a performance using multiple self-managing 'instruments' and play them as I build them. By doing this I can think reasonably laterally about the performance, building up and packing down individual 'instruments' as I need them, while all of the existing 'instruments' continue playing. It also has some functionality such as automatic crossfading which is very useful for creating smooth performances.

In addition, while I don't use it very much, the `ProxyMixer` class uses SuperCollider's GUI to automatically create a visual mixer to change the levels of all 'instruments' created.

I've written two extended examples of how I use ProxySpace which are in this folder. They are musical examples that I would use in live performances I deliver. Open them up in your SuperCollider IDE and follow along. If you are browsing via GitHub Pages, the tutorials can be found [here for basics](https://github.com/theseanco/howto_co34pt_liveCode/blob/master/2:%20Basics/2.2:%20ProxySpace%20-%20My%20Foundation%20For%20Live%20Coding%20In%20SuperCollider/2.2:%20ProxySpace%20Basics.scd) and [here for patterns](https://github.com/theseanco/howto_co34pt_liveCode/blob/master/2:%20Basics/2.2:%20ProxySpace%20-%20My%20Foundation%20For%20Live%20Coding%20In%20SuperCollider/2.2:%20ProxySpace%20Patterns.scd)

ProxySpace (and JITLib in general) also have *great* documentation, which i'd recommend:
- [ProxySpace Examples](http://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/JITLib/proxyspace_examples.html)
- The [JITLib Basic Concepts](http://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/JITLib/jitlib_basic_concepts_01.html) series
